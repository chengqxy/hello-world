# hello-world

I'm a 27 year old lady who loves coffee, tea and all things sweet. As a registered respiratory therapist, I work with critically ill patients in a hospital in Singapore. Aside from work, I love travelling, finding delicious cuisine, chasing beautiful sceneries and admiring the finer things in life as I continue to search and contemplate the meaning of this life. Welcome to my world!
